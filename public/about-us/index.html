                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 m-2">Its Birth & Growth</h1>
                <h1 class="text-lg font-bold text-slate-700 m-2">The dream of BJM Carmel Academy dawned in 1996 in the mind of Rev. Fr Mathew Kaniamparampil, the then President of CMI Service Society, an educational society owned and managed by the CMI Fathers. This dream of the President was ably nurtured by the untiring efforts of the founding Principal, Rev. Fr. Joy Parapilly and his team Rev Fr. Johnson Thekkudan and Rev. Fr. Benny Mukalel. A special mention is due here of the amount of hard work put in by Rev. Fr. Tomy Chirapurath, who painstakingly went around the locality promoting the cause of this new venture in quality education to the citizens of Chandrapur. Thus the institution had a humble but firm footing. This new venture in quality education shone under the able leadership of Rev. Fr. Peter Valiaparampil, and his team Rev Fr. George CC, Rev. Fr. Jaison and Rev. Fr. Binoy. The institution reached new heights in the following years, the decinial of which was celebrated in 2006 as the institution completed ten successful years of its existence. The institution soared into greater heights under the able leadership of Rev. Fr. Jose Manickathan CMI, and his team, Fr. Prem, Fr. Joy, Fr. Benny, Fr. Thomas, Fr. Johny, Fr. Chrysostom, Fr. Jaison Jacob, Fr. Anish and Fr. Joseph Lukose and Fr. Benny followed the path of their predecessors in the true sense.</h1>
